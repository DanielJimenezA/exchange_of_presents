# Exchange of Presents (Frontend for GitHub Pages)

This is a static frontend meant for GitHub Pages.

## Important
This site needs a **public backend URL** (Render/Railway/etc.).
If you open this on GitHub Pages and haven't configured the backend URL, it will prompt you once.

You can also set it manually in the console:
```js
localStorage.setItem('backend_url','https://your-backend.onrender.com');
location.reload();
```
